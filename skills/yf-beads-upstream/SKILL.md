# yf-beads-upstream

A **utility skill** (no formula / `bd mol pour` / coordinator) that binds a beads workspace
to an upstream issue tracker. It owns three operations: `init` (configure a backend), the
**push step** (land-the-plane: push open/deferred beads upstream), and **status/pull**
(treat upstream issues as the worklist). GitHub is fully implemented; GitLab/Jira ship as
config-only stubs sharing the same verb shape.

Built on bd 1.0.5's first-class `bd github` / `bd gitlab` / `bd jira` upstream sync. For the
`bd` CLI gotchas these steps rely on (defensive `--json` parsing, issue-type semantics) see
`yf-beads-extra`.

## SKILL_DIR

```bash
GIT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo .)
SKILL_DIR=$(find ~/.claude/skills ~/.agents/skills "$GIT_ROOT/.claude/skills" "$GIT_ROOT/.agents/skills" .claude/skills .agents/skills -maxdepth 1 -name yf-beads-upstream -type d 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$SKILL_DIR" ] && { echo "ERROR: yf-beads-upstream skill directory not found"; exit 1; }
```

All skill-internal paths use `${SKILL_DIR}/` prefix.

## Trigger split (the load-bearing design)

Two distinct trigger classes, deliberately routed to two different surfaces:

- **Intent triggers → this SKILL's `description`.** `init`, `status`/pull, "set up upstream
  tracking", "push beads upstream". Description-matching catches these reliably because the
  user states the intent.
- **Procedural trigger → the always-loaded companion rule** (`protocols/UPSTREAM_TRACKING.md`,
  installed to the rules surface). The push-at-session-close / land-the-plane step is *not*
  reliably caught by a description — nobody says "trigger the upstream skill" when wrapping
  up — so the rule binds it and is in context every turn. The rule is minimal: the close-time
  trigger + the one safety invariant + a pointer here. All procedure lives in this SKILL.

## Backends

| Backend  | Config namespace                         | Status      |
|:---------|:-----------------------------------------|:------------|
| `github` | `github.owner` / `github.repo` / token   | implemented, dry-run-tested |
| `gitlab` | `gitlab.*`                               | config-only stub (unverified) |
| `jira`   | `jira.*`                                 | config-only stub (unverified; field model differs) |
| `none`   | `custom.upstream.enabled` ≠ `true`       | first-class **default**: upstream tracking disabled |

**Default-deny.** Upstream is enabled only when `custom.upstream.enabled` is the literal string
`true`. Anything else — key **absent/empty** (unconfigured), `false`, or `none` — resolves to
disabled. So a repo that never ran `init` (no `custom.upstream.*` keys) fails **closed**, and a
repo initialized before this default existed still fails closed. The explicit `none` marker
(`custom.upstream.backend none`) is **disambiguation only** — it records a deliberate opt-out so
the preflight offer (init §0) stays silent; it is never required for the disabled short-circuit.

Auth is always passed **inline, never persisted**: `TOKEN=$(...) bd <backend> sync …`.

## `/yf-beads-upstream init`

Configure the backend only. `init` does **not** write any rule file into the project — the
trigger contract ships as this skill's companion rule (installed by `yf skills install`).

### 0 — Preflight detect-and-offer (gated, one-shot)

This is the **procedure** behind the gated trigger declared in `protocols/UPSTREAM_TRACKING.md`.
It fires at most once, and only when **both** gates hold:

1. **Origin is github/gitlab.** `git config --get remote.origin.url` matches `github.com` or a
   `gitlab.*` host. (A non-github/gitlab origin — or no origin — never offers.)
2. **Upstream is unconfigured.** The **same key/precedence as the §0 push short-circuit**:
   `bd config get custom.upstream.enabled` is neither `true` (already enabled) nor a value the
   operator already chose. "Unconfigured" means the key is **absent/empty** — no
   `custom.upstream.enabled` and no explicit `none` marker (`custom.upstream.backend`). An
   explicit `false`/`none` is a *recorded decision*, not unconfigured: do **not** offer.

```bash
ENABLED=$(bd config get custom.upstream.enabled 2>/dev/null)
BACKEND=$(bd config get custom.upstream.backend 2>/dev/null)
# Offer ONLY when both are empty (truly unconfigured). Any non-empty value = decision already made.
[ -z "$ENABLED" ] && [ -z "$BACKEND" ]   # ⇒ candidate for the one-shot offer
```

**Interactive-context guard.** Offer **only** in a context that can persist the decision (can run
`AskUserQuestion` *and* write config). In a read-only preflight that cannot write a marker, do
**not** offer — an un-persisted decline would re-fire next time, becoming a nag. When it cannot
persist, silently fall through to the disabled default.

When both gates hold and the context can persist, `AskUserQuestion`:

- **Configure now** → run the rest of this `init` flow (§1–§4). The backend keys written in §3
  are the durable marker.
- **Decline** → write the explicit `none` marker immediately (§3 `none` block:
  `custom.upstream.enabled false` + `custom.upstream.backend none`). This is the durable marker
  that makes the offer a **silent no-op forever** — gate (2) now fails (non-empty values), so a
  second preflight produces **zero** prompts.

Either outcome writes a durable marker, so the offer never fires twice. Both gates read the same
config key as F.1's push/status short-circuit, so an already-enabled or already-declined repo is
never re-offered.

### 1 — Detect the remote and propose a backend

```bash
REMOTE_URL=$(git config --get remote.origin.url 2>/dev/null)
```

- `github.com` → propose `github`; `gitlab.*` → propose `gitlab`; otherwise propose `none`.
- Parse `owner`/`repo` from the URL (`…/<owner>/<repo>(.git)`).

### 2 — Confirm with the operator

Use `AskUserQuestion`: backend = `github` | `gitlab` | `jira` | `none` (detected default first).
`none` is a first-class choice — upstream tracking fully disabled. Declining without writing any
key also resolves to disabled (default-deny), but prefer writing the explicit `none` marker (§3)
so the gated offer (§0) stays silent thereafter.

### 3 — Write config

**GitHub** (analogous keys for `gitlab.*` / `jira.*`):

```bash
bd config set github.owner "<owner>"
bd config set github.repo  "<repo>"
bd config set custom.upstream.enabled true
bd config set custom.upstream.backend github
```

Never write a token to config. Auth is inline at call time: `GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) bd github …`.

**`none`** — write an explicit *opted-out* marker. Default-deny already makes an unconfigured repo
disabled, so this marker is **not** what disables sync — it records a *deliberate* opt-out so the
gated preflight offer (§0) recognizes the decision and stays silent forever. Re-running `init` can
re-enable:

```bash
bd config set custom.upstream.enabled false
bd config set custom.upstream.backend none
```

### 4 — `dolt.local-only` guard

Upstream tracking assumes the dolt DB is local-only (issues live upstream, not in a dolt remote).
Before flipping it, detect an existing remote — the operator may run one intentionally:

```bash
bd config get dolt.local-only          # current value
bd dolt remote list                    # any configured remote?
```

If a dolt remote **is** configured, confirm with the operator before `bd config set dolt.local-only true`.
If none, set it. Skip the flip entirely for backend `none`.

## Push step (land-the-plane)

Push **open + deferred** beads (blocked, descoped, discovered-but-not-done, follow-ups) upstream
as the session/plan closes. Closed beads are never pushed.

### 0 — Disabled short-circuit (first, always)

**Default-deny:** enabled only when the value is exactly `true`; treat empty/unset/`false`/`none`
as disabled.

```bash
[ "$(bd config get custom.upstream.enabled 2>/dev/null)" = "true" ] || {
  echo "upstream tracking disabled"; exit 0; }
```

If the value is anything other than the literal `true` (unconfigured, `false`, or `none`): report
"upstream tracking disabled" and **exit 0**. No enumeration, no prompt, no upstream call.

### 1 — Auth pre-flight

Verify the token resolves **before** any push; fail fast on empty/expired:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token 2>/dev/null)
[ -z "$GITHUB_TOKEN" ] && { echo "ERROR: no GitHub token (run: gh auth login)"; exit 1; }
```

### 2 — Enumerate candidates

```bash
uv run ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/upstream.py enumerate --json   # open+blocked+deferred, not-yet-mapped
```

The helper (see `scripts/upstream.py`) lists candidate bead IDs and flags those already carrying
an `External:` mapping (parsed defensively per `yf-beads-extra`). Present the set; the operator
confirms the scoped IDs.

### 3 — Dry-run, then scoped push

Use the dedicated `bd github push` (≡ `bd github sync --push-only --issues <ids>`); **never a bare
`bd github sync`**:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) bd github push <id1> <id2> … --dry-run   # confirm only intended beads
GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) bd github push <id1> <id2> …             # real push
```

(For a whole subtree: `bd github sync --push-only --parent <id> --dry-run`.) After a successful
push, bd records the new issue URL on each bead as a single `External:` line in `bd show <id>`:

```
External: https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>
```

This mapping is what suppresses duplicate creation on re-push (verified live on 1.0.5 — see step 5).

### 4 — Partial-push / failure handling

On non-zero `bd github push` exit: re-enumerate `External:` mappings, report **pushed-vs-remaining**
beads, and surface (never swallow) the error:

```bash
uv run ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/upstream.py mappings --issues <id1>,<id2>,… --json
```

Do not blind-retry — a re-run on already-mapped beads is safe (step 5) but must be a *deliberate*
re-push of the remaining set, not a bare sync.

### 5 — Idempotency checkpoint (gates this step)

A re-push of an already-mapped bead must **not** create a duplicate upstream issue. This rests on
bd recording the `External:` mapping and suppressing re-push for mapped beads. **Verify on the live
binary against a throwaway repo before relying on it** (see `spec/` / the build-time check): dry-run
+ real scoped push of a fresh bead, then re-push the same bead and confirm no second issue. If
`bd github push` does not record the mapping the way bare `sync` does, redesign the recovery story
before trusting re-push.

> **Verified (bd 1.0.5, throwaway repo, 2026-06-01):** `bd github push <id>` records
> `External: …/issues/N` on the bead; a second `bd github push <id>` left the upstream issue count
> at 1 (no duplicate — it updates the mapped issue). The dedicated `push` subcommand records the
> mapping identically to bare `sync`, so scoped re-push is safe for partial-failure recovery.

### 6 — Updating a mapped bead (only the `description` field syncs)

**The accepted pattern for getting new content onto an already-mapped bead's upstream issue: put
it in the bead's `description`, then re-push.** bd's GitHub sync maps **`description` → issue body
only**. The `notes` (and `design`) fields are **not** synced — editing them via `bd update --notes`
bumps the issue's `updatedAt` on the next push but the text never reaches the body. So:

1. **Fold the content into `description`** (the synced field). Don't rely on `--notes` for anything
   that must travel upstream — keep `description` the single canonical place. (Alternative when the
   description should stay terse: post the text as a `gh issue comment` directly — but that comment
   is *not* bead-synced and won't update on future pushes; prefer folding into `description`.)
2. **Re-push** — `bd github push <id>`. The dry-run must read **`Would update in GitHub`**, not
   `Would create` (confirms the `External:` mapping is in force; a `create` means the mapping was
   lost — stop and investigate before duplicating).
3. **Verify** the new text is in the body: `gh issue view <N> --json body --jq '.body' | grep …`,
   and that the open-issue count is unchanged.

> **Verified (bd 1.0.5, 2026-06-07):** updating only `--notes` and re-pushing left the issue body
> unchanged (timestamp bumped, no content); folding the same text into `--description` and
> re-pushing carried it into the body, still a single issue (in-place update).

**`bd show <id> --json` returns a JSON *list*, not an object** (per `yf-beads-extra` defensive parsing).
When reconstructing a `description` to append to, index `[0]` — a parse that assumes a dict yields an
empty string, and `bd update --description "$empty"` **silently clobbers the existing description**
(`bd update` replaces, never appends). Read → verify non-empty → append → write; if you do clobber,
the prior text survives in the upstream issue body and can be recovered from there.

## Status / pull

First read the config and apply the **default-deny** test — enabled only when the value is
exactly `true`:

```bash
[ "$(bd config get custom.upstream.enabled 2>/dev/null)" = "true" ]   # true ⇒ enabled, else disabled
```

**Disabled (anything ≠ `true` — unconfigured, `false`, or `none`):** report "upstream tracking
disabled" and fall back to the local worklist — `bd ready` (unblocked) then
`bd list --status open` (full inventory). No upstream calls.

**Enabled:** the upstream tracker is the authoritative worklist (the local bead set may be
stale). Enumerate open upstream issues, ordered by labels/priority:

```bash
gh issue list --repo "<owner>/<repo>" --state open \
  --json number,title,labels,url --jq 'sort_by(.labels)'
```

Order the execution sequence by the issues' labels (severity/priority, `bug` before
`enhancement`, blocked-by relationships). Local beads are a convenience view over this list.
`bd github status` shows sync state (config + last-sync) but is not the worklist.

(GitLab/Jira: substitute `glab issue list` / Jira JQL — see Backend generalization.)

## Backend generalization

GitHub is the implemented, dry-run-and-live-tested path (see Push step step 5). GitLab and
Jira are **config-only stubs** — the config keys and verb shape are wired, but no push has
been exercised against a live GitLab/Jira instance. Do not present them as tested.

All three backends expose `push` / `pull` / `status` / `sync` subcommands. Scoped-push
translation (verified against `bd <backend> sync --help` on 1.0.5):

| Step          | GitHub                              | GitLab                              | Jira (unverified)                          |
|:--------------|:------------------------------------|:------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Config        | `github.owner` / `github.repo`      | `gitlab.*` (+ `--project` group id) | `jira.*`                                    |
| Scoped push   | `bd github push <ids>`              | `bd gitlab push <ids>`              | `bd jira push <ids>`                        |
| ≡ sync form   | `sync --push-only --issues <ids>`   | `sync --push-only --issues <ids>`   | `sync --push --issues <ids>` ⚠             |
| Subtree push  | `sync --push-only --parent <id>`    | `sync --push-only --parent <id>`    | `sync --push --parent <id>` ⚠              |
| Dry-run       | `--dry-run`                         | `--dry-run`                         | `--dry-run`                                 |

⚠ **Jira divergence:** `bd jira sync` uses `--push` / `--pull` (not `--push-only` /
`--pull-only`) and adds `--create-only` for new-issues-only. Jira's field model (projects,
issue types, required fields) differs from GitHub/GitLab labels — the stub is unverified and
will likely need field mapping before a real push. Prefer the dedicated `bd jira push <ids>`
subcommand, which mirrors the others' positional-IDs shape.

The `--issues` / `--parent` / `--dry-run` flags are confirmed present on backend-generic
`bd <backend> sync` for all three (plan-003 Investigation Finding; re-verified here via
`bd <backend> sync --help`). The never-bare-`sync` invariant applies to every backend.

## Safety invariants

- **Never run a bare `bd <backend> sync`.** A bare sync re-imports every upstream issue as a
  duplicate bead and pushes the entire local DB (closed epics, gates, dupes) upstream. Always
  `--push-only` + scoped `--issues <ids>` (or `--parent <id>`), `--dry-run` first.
- **Auth is inline-only.** `TOKEN=$(...) bd <backend> sync …` — never write a token to config.
- **Disabled (`none`) is honored everywhere.** Push and status no-op cleanly; the close-time
  rule trigger is a silent no-op.
- **Only `description` syncs upstream.** Content that must reach the issue body goes in the bead's
  `description`, not `notes`/`design`; `bd update --description` replaces (never appends), and
  `bd show --json` is a list — see Push step §6.
