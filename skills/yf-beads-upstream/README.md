# beads-upstream

Configurable, GitHub-first upstream-tracking skill for beads. Pushes open/deferred beads to
an issue tracker (GitHub/GitLab/Jira) as a land-the-plane step, and enumerates upstream issues
as the authoritative worklist on status/pull. A **utility skill** — no formula, `bd mol pour`,
or coordinator loop.

## Prerequisites

- `bd` (beads) >= 1.0.5 — provides first-class `bd github` / `bd gitlab` / `bd jira` sync.
- For the GitHub backend: the `gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth status`), used to mint an inline
  token (`gh auth token`).
- `uv` — runs the `scripts/` Python helper (PEP 723 inline deps).
- `git` — remote-URL detection during `init`.

## Install

Installed by the repo-level `install.sh`, which auto-discovers every `skills/*/` directory. The
skill ships one **companion rule** (`protocols/UPSTREAM_TRACKING.md`) that `install.sh` surfaces
to the install's rules dir (always-loaded), and **no hook**. No install changes needed. See the
project [README](../../README.md) for `install.sh` flags.

## Usage

User-invocable (`/beads-upstream`). Operations:

- `/beads-upstream init` — detect git remote → propose backend (`github|gitlab|jira|none`) →
  write `<backend>.*` config. `none` fully disables upstream tracking (a first-class, re-enableable choice).
- `/beads-upstream` (push) — land-the-plane: push open/deferred beads upstream (scoped, dry-run-first).
- `/beads-upstream status` — enumerate the upstream worklist (or fall back to local `bd` when disabled).

The **close-time / land-the-plane push trigger** is not invoked by intent language; it is bound
by the always-loaded companion rule `protocols/UPSTREAM_TRACKING.md`.

### Hoist / land-the-plane / un-hoist

At land-the-plane, follow-on beads can be **hoisted** upstream and removed locally so the local DB
stays "active work only." The `scripts/upstream.py` helper exposes:

- `hoist --issues <ids> --dest <d> [--apply]` — ensure an upstream issue per granularity
  (create-or-map via the bd `External:` mapping), dry-run the push first, then `bd close -r` each
  bead with a destination-recording reason — a **reversible tombstone**, never `bd delete`.
- `land --parent <id> --intake <ts> --dest <d> [--apply]` — detect follow-ons under a plan subtree
  and hoist them. **Default = propose-with-confirm** (emit the batch, require `--apply`). The
  **no-prompt** path runs only when `custom.upstream.auto_hoist_followons=true` and is restricted to
  the **narrow** signal (`discovered-from` into the subtree AND non-active). The **broad** signal
  (created-after-intake) may catch a bead still being worked, so it is never auto-hoisted.
- `unhoist (--issues <ids> | --record <file>) [--apply]` — reopen a wrongly-hoisted bead from its
  tombstone (`bd update <id> --status open`); the upstream issue stays.

Preserved safety invariants: never a bare `bd <backend> sync` (scoped `--issues`, dry-run first);
auth is inline-only, never persisted; removal is `bd close -r`, never `bd delete`.

### Config knobs

- `custom.upstream.granularity` — `coarse` (default) files one tracking issue per plan-scale effort;
  `granular` files one per hoisted bead. Unset/unrecognized → `coarse`. **`coarse` is the tested
  happy path**; `granular` is implemented but not the tested-happy-path. They **coexist**: flipping
  `coarse`→`granular` leaves existing coarse trackers intact, since hoist is create-or-map via the
  `External:` dedup (an already-mapped bead updates in place, not re-created).
- `custom.upstream.auto_hoist_followons` — **default-deny** (enabled only on literal `true`,
  mirroring `custom.upstream.enabled`); opt-in for the unattended no-prompt land-the-plane path,
  restricted to the narrow signal. Inspect both via `upstream.py config --json`.

## Behavior model

No phase model (utility skill). Three independent operations, each honoring the disabled (`none`) flag:

```
init     → detect remote → propose backend → bd config set <backend>.* (or custom.upstream.enabled=false)
push     → read config → disabled? no-op : enumerate open/deferred → --dry-run scoped push → confirm → push → record External: map
status   → read config → disabled? local bd ready/list : enumerate upstream issues as worklist
hoist    → ensure issue per granularity (create-or-map via External:) → --dry-run push → push → bd close -r (reversible)
land     → detect follow-ons (narrow vs broad) → propose-with-confirm (default) | narrow-only no-prompt (opt-in) → hoist
unhoist  → reopen wrongly-hoisted bead from close_reason tombstone (upstream issue stays)
```

Safety invariant (everywhere): never a bare `bd <backend> sync`; always `--push-only` + scoped
`--issues`/`--parent` + `--dry-run` first. Auth is inline-only, never persisted. Removal is
`bd close -r` (reversible tombstone), never `bd delete`.
