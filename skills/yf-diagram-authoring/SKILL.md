# diagram-authoring

Author diagrams as **d2** source and render light-mode, white-background PNGs. d2 is the single
diagram engine: cleaner syntax than mermaid, stronger auto-layout (elk), fully local/offline.
Every diagram keeps its `.d2` source beside the `.png` render — never temp-and-discard.

`scripts/render.py` (run via `uv run`) wraps every d2 call: `preflight`, `render <file.d2>`,
`render-dir <dir>`, `check-dir <dir>`. Defaults: `--theme 0` (light), `--layout elk`.

## Workflow

1. **Preflight.** `uv run scripts/render.py preflight` — confirms `d2` is on PATH (the *only*
   contract; OS-independent). If missing: `brew install d2`. First PNG render fetches a one-time
   ~140MB Chromium; on this toolchain that warm-up is owned by the dotfiles bootstrap, not this
   skill — just render and let any fetch happen.
2. **Write `<slug>.d2`** into the caller's diagrams location (see below). Slug is kebab-case,
   derived from the section/topic.
3. **Render** `uv run scripts/render.py render <slug>.d2` → sibling `<slug>.png` (theme 0, elk).
4. **Verify by Read.** Open the PNG: white background, labels legible, structure correct. Fix the
   `.d2` and re-render on any problem — never hand-edit the `.png`.

## Output location (caller-supplied; the skill hardcodes nothing)

| Consumer | Location | Referenced from |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| bdplan (plans) | `<plan_dir>/diagrams/<slug>.{d2,png}` | `plan.md` |
| bdresearch (reports) | `<research_dir>/diagrams/<slug>.{d2,png}` | report body / `_index.md` |
| skill-authoring (specs) | co-resident in `skills/<name>/spec/<slug>.{d2,png}` (no subfolder) | skill `README.md` |
| top-level / user-facing docs | `<repo-root>/docs/diagrams/<slug>.{d2,png}` | project `README.md` |
| standalone | `./diagrams/` (override freely) | — |

**Skill-spec vs repo-level — placement test.** Put a diagram in `skills/<name>/spec/` **only** if
it documents the **skill itself** (its engine/model, repo-agnostic, ships with the skill). A
diagram of a **specific repo's** content or config is repo-level → `docs/diagrams/`, referenced
from a top-level doc — never a skill `spec/`. Trap: the `drift-check` skill and a repo's
`DRIFT-CHECK.md` manifest share a name, so a diagram of *a repo's* `DRIFT-CHECK.md` graph reads as
"drift-check" but is repo-level config → `docs/diagrams/`, not `skills/drift-check/spec/`.

## README image references

Reference a render with markdown image syntax and a **relative** path (survives skill install):
`![<alt>](spec/<slug>.png)` from a skill README; `![<alt>](docs/diagrams/<slug>.png)` from the
project README or other top-level docs. The `.d2` source always sits beside the referenced `.png`.

## Regeneration discipline

A `.d2` edited without re-rendering leaves a stale `.png`. Before committing, run
`uv run scripts/render.py render-dir <dir>` to regenerate all, then `check-dir <dir>` —
authoritative on missing renders (exit 1 on any `.d2` with no `.png`), advisory on staleness
(WARN when a `.d2` is newer than its `.png` in the same tree; cross-clone freshness can't be
enforced because git normalizes mtimes).

## When to diagram

Diagram when structure is easier *shown* than described: >2 interacting components, a
lifecycle/state machine, a data model, a dependency or org graph. Skip trivial 1–2 node
relationships and pure prose. Consumers that "always attempt" (bdplan, bdresearch) generate ≥1
for any non-trivial artifact; skill-authoring is conditional ("if it aids the description").

## d2 authoring notes (ported durable knowledge)

- **Line breaks in labels:** d2 renders `\n` inside a quoted label as a newline —
  `node: "First line\nSecond line"` (mermaid's `<br/>` equivalent; do not use `<br/>`).
- **Rich labels:** markdown blocks — `node: |md **Bold**\n- point |` — for multi-line/styled text.
- **Sizing:** d2 auto-layouts; no fixed width/height like mermaid's `-w/-H`. Tune with `--scale`
  (sharper/larger) and `--pad`; prefer `elk` for dense/nested graphs, `--layout dagre` for simple
  left-to-right flows. `direction: right|down|left|up` sets flow direction.
- **Theme/background:** theme `0` is light with a white background (guaranteed opaque) — keep it.

## Diagram types by domain

- **Software architecture / flow:** containers (`group: { a; b }`), connections `a -> b: label`,
  `shape: sequence_diagram` for service/API interactions, `shape: cylinder` for stores. Show
  component boundaries and data/control flow.
- **Org / planning:** hierarchy via nesting or `manager -> report`, swimlane-style groups for
  teams/phases, `shape: queue` / milestones for sequenced plans.
- **World-building / conceptual structure:** nested containers for taxonomies/regions, typed
  connections for relationships (`a -> b: rules`), markdown labels for lore/notes. Favor `elk`
  for deep nesting.
