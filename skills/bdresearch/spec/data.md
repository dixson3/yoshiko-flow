# Data Specification

Anchors on-disk layout, the credibility model, and config. Verified against SKILL.md,
`scripts/index_manager.py`, `scripts/credibility_scorer.py`, and
`scripts/research_manager.py`.

REQ-DATA-001: Research outputs live under one of two roots — `docs/research/<NNN>-<slug>/` (default) or `Incubator/<slug>/research/<NNN>-<slug>/` (incubator-scoped). The `<NNN>` index is global across both roots.
Rationale: Global numbering keeps cross-references unambiguous regardless of root.
Verification: SKILL.md Phase 2 (root detection + global `count`).

REQ-DATA-002: Each research topic uses the layout: `plan.yaml`, `Summary.md`, `sources.json`, `_index.md`, `scripts/`, `artifacts/` (with `cluster-<name>.md`, `triangulation.md`, `critique.md`).
Rationale: A fixed layout lets the coordinator and a cold reader locate every artifact.
Verification: SKILL.md Phase 3 (`mkdir`); `index_manager.py`; `agents/*.md` outputs.

REQ-DATA-003: `sources.json` holds every source with a credibility score; every factual claim in `Summary.md`/artifacts carries an inline `[N]` that resolves to a `sources.json` entry.
Rationale: Citations are the contract; an unresolved citation is a defect.
Verification: `spec/epistemics.md`; `agents/packager.md` citation check.

REQ-DATA-004: Source credibility is a 4-factor weighted model — domain authority 35%, currency 20%, expertise 25%, bias neutrality 20% — categorizing sources as `high_trust | verify | questionable | avoid`.
Rationale: A fixed rubric makes scores reproducible and independently checkable by the critic.
Verification: `scripts/credibility_scorer.py`.

REQ-DATA-005: `_index.md` is the artifact manifest, created/updated only via `index_manager.py` (`init`, `add`).
Rationale: A single writer prevents drift in the manifest format.
Verification: `scripts/index_manager.py`; coordinator/packager call sites.

REQ-DATA-006: Per the Skill Surface Convention, operator config (`ignore-skill`) lives at `.bdresearch.local.json` (repo root, gitignored); runtime state (`prereqs-present` cache) lives at `.state/bdresearch/preflight.json`; the installed rule (in the scope+surface rules dir, e.g. `~/.<surface>/rules/RESEARCH.md`, installed by `install.sh`) is hash-checked against `protocols/manifest.json` (schema_version 1). `/bdresearch init` adds anchored `.gitignore` entries `/.bdresearch.local.json` and `/.state/` (no globs).
Rationale: Config = operator decisions a fresh clone needs; state = recomputable cache tied to one checkout; the manifest hash detects rule drift/staleness. Conflating these commits machine-local state or loses operator intent.
Verification: `research_manager.py` `CONFIG_FILE` vs `STATE_FILE`; `_read_config()`/`_read_state()`/`_write_state()`; `_check_rule()` + `MANIFEST_FILE`; `protocols/manifest.json`; SKILL.md `/bdresearch init` gitignore step.

REQ-DATA-007: `plan.yaml` carries `topic`, `mode`, `priority`, `research_dir`, `questions` (primary/secondary), `source_clusters`, `tooling_needed`, `execution`.
Rationale: The plan is the single approved input the pipeline executes against.
Verification: SKILL.md Phase 2 plan.yaml structure.
