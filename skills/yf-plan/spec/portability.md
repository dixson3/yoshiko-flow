# Portability Specification

<!-- activation: 2026-04-05 -->

Plans are portable artifacts. A cold reader on a different machine, in a different repo, with no access to the drafting conversation, must be able to understand why a plan exists, what environment it assumes, what reviewers flagged, and what upstream issues it resolves — from the plan folder alone.

## Activation

REQ-PORT-ACT: The portability contract activated on **2026-04-05**. Plans whose first `scoping:` phase-log entry is on or after this date are subject to hard audit enforcement at intake. Plans whose first scoping entry is earlier are grandfathered: missing scaffolding yields `warn` findings instead of `fail`.
Rationale: Pre-existing plans in other projects must not be blocked from intake on their next use. The activation date lets new plans get full enforcement while giving existing plans a graceful migration path via `/yf-plan capture`.
Verification: `plan_manager.py::PORTABILITY_ACTIVATION_DATE` matches the date in this file's activation header.

## Contract

REQ-PORT-001: Every plan folder (under either `docs/plans/<plan-id>/` or `Incubator/<slug>/plans/<plan-id>/`) must contain `README.md` at the plan root with file-map and reading-order sections.
Rationale: The README is the entry point for a cold reader. Without it, the reader has no orientation to the folder's contents.
Verification: `plan_manager.py audit` checks file presence and required section headers `File map` and `Reading order`.

REQ-PORT-002: Every plan folder must contain `context.md` at the plan root with non-empty required sections: Project environment, Tool inventory, Paths, Operator identity, Runtime assumptions.
Rationale: Runtime assumptions and tool versions are load-bearing but never derivable from `plan.md` alone. A cold reader on a different machine needs to know whether the plan is safe to execute as-is.
Verification: `plan_manager.py audit` enforces per-section non-emptiness. Optional sections (Adjacent-concept glossary, Additional context) may be empty.

REQ-PORT-003: `context.md` Tool inventory section must include a snapshot header of the form `<!-- snapshot: host=<hostname> date=<YYYY-MM-DD> -->`. Tool versions are recorded as best-effort; missing tools are `not present`.
Rationale: Tool snapshots are inherently machine-specific. The header tells the cold reader where and when the snapshot was taken so they can judge staleness.
Verification: `_detect_tools` in `plan_manager.py` produces the snapshot header via `_portability_snapshot_header`.

REQ-PORT-004: Every plan must capture its motivation — the "why this exists" — either as a `## Motivation` section in `plan.md` or as a `motivation.md` file at the plan root. Neither may be empty nor contain only the seed placeholder text.
Rationale: The motivating use case is the most-likely-to-be-lost class of context during scope reframings. A cold reader cannot judge a plan's value without it.
Verification: `plan_manager.py audit` checks both locations and rejects placeholder text.

REQ-PORT-005: Every non-exclude row in plan.md's Upstream Issues table must have a corresponding `references/upstream-<N>.md` file containing the full issue body, URL, state, and labels.
Rationale: Upstream issue bodies must travel with the plan folder. `gh issue view` does not resolve across repositories and does not work offline.
Verification: `plan_manager.py audit` counts non-exclude rows and `references/upstream-*.md` files; counts must match.

REQ-PORT-006: The number of `reviews/pass-*.md` files must equal the number of `^- \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} review:` lines in plan.md's phase log. `pass-N.md` and its phase-log `review:` line are written together as a single atomic step **at red-team presentation** (create-on-present, #4), not after the operator resolves concerns. `N` is the review-line count immediately after that line is appended. Because file and line always land together, the count-equality holds *while a plan sits in `review`* with concerns still outstanding — exactly the state the audit must accept as portable.
Rationale: Red-team verdicts degrade to one-line phase-log entries unless captured. Writing at presentation (rather than after resolution) means a plan parked in `review`/REVISE has its verdict on disk, not only in the drafting conversation. Strict correspondence prevents silent loss on REVISE loops. The audit's `_plan_review_line_count` coupling is unchanged: it still counts review lines and compares to `pass-*.md` files — the only change is *when* both are written.
Verification: `plan_manager.py audit` compares `len(glob('reviews/pass-*.md'))` to `_plan_review_line_count`; SKILL.md Phase 3 Review § "Write the report at presentation" states file + phase-log line are a single atomic step at presentation.

REQ-PORT-008: A `pass-N.md` file is **mutable until resolved, then frozen**. It is written at presentation with an Operator Resolutions table marked `unresolved`; as concerns are resolved the same file is updated in place (rows filled, statuses flipped to `resolved`); once all concerns are resolved the file is frozen and never edited again. A REVISE loop is a new review cycle that produces a new `pass-(N+1).md` at the next presentation — files are updated in place within a cycle, never replaced across cycles. Each full review cycle yields exactly one file.
Rationale: The portability benefit of #4 is that the verdict exists on disk before resolution; that requires the file to be mutable during resolution. Freezing after resolution preserves the audit trail. "One file per cycle" prevents both silent loss and churn.
Verification: SKILL.md Phase 3 Review § "Update in place on resolution" and "Lifecycle: mutable until resolved, then frozen" subsections; `agents/red-team.md` Rules.

REQ-PORT-007: Plan files may not contain dangling external references. Dangling is defined as: absolute paths matching `/Users/`, `/home/`, `/opt/`, `/var/`, `/tmp/`, `/etc/`, or `C:\`; or parent-traversal `../`. Repo-relative paths (`skills/yf-plan/SKILL.md`) are explicitly allowed. Content inside fenced code blocks and inline code spans is exempt — pattern documentation and command examples legitimately mention such paths.
Rationale: Absolute paths and parent-traversal break the moment a plan folder moves. Repo-relative paths are portable under any repo clone.
Verification: `plan_manager.py audit` greps all plan files after stripping code spans.

## Audit Invariants

REQ-PORT-010: The portability audit is **mechanical only** — file existence, grep, placeholder detection, regex. No semantic evaluation. No LLM calls.
Rationale: Semantic audits are non-deterministic and cannot be version-controlled. Mechanical checks produce the same verdict on the same input forever.
Verification: `_audit_plan` in `plan_manager.py` uses only stdlib (`pathlib`, `re`, `subprocess`) — no external deps beyond click.

REQ-PORT-011: The audit overall status is `pass` iff no finding has status `fail`. Warn findings do not degrade overall status. A `fail` finding halts intake.
Rationale: Two-level severity lets the grandfather clause downgrade without removing the audit entirely.
Verification: `_audit_plan` sets `status = "fail" if any_fail else "pass"`.

REQ-PORT-012: The audit runs as the **last step of Phase 3 (PLAN)**, after red-team approval and before transition to Phase 4 (INTAKE). It is idempotent — safe to run multiple times during plan development. It is a script exit-code check, NOT a bd gate. The term "gate" is reserved for bd gates.
Rationale: The audit validates the planning output, not the intake machinery. Running it at end-of-PLAN lets the operator iterate on gaps (or use `/yf-plan capture`) while still in the planning phase. Idempotency means re-running after fixes is free.
Verification: SKILL.md Phase 3 "Portability audit" subsection contains the audit dispatch snippet; Phase 4 has no audit call; no `bd create -t gate` in the audit path.

## Override

REQ-PORT-020: The operator may bypass the portability audit with an explicit `--force` on approval (e.g., "approve --force"). The override must append a phase-log entry of the form `- YYYY-MM-DD approved: portability audit overridden — reasoning: <operator reason>`. Unlogged overrides are forbidden.
Rationale: A hard audit with no escape hatch produces operator frustration in legitimate edge cases; an unlogged escape hatch hides quality regressions. Mandatory reasoning gives the audit teeth without blocking operator judgment.
Verification: SKILL.md Phase 3 "Portability audit" subsection documents the override and the phase-log line format.

## /yf-plan capture

REQ-PORT-030: `/yf-plan capture [<plan-id>]` is re-entrant, status-agnostic (runs in any phase before intake), and **does not advance plan status**. It does not mutate beads or pour molecules.
Rationale: Capture is a maintenance operation on the plan folder, not a phase transition. Advancing status would conflict with the scoping/investigating/drafting workflow.
Verification: SKILL.md "Phase: CAPTURE (manual)" section explicitly states "does NOT advance plan status"; `/yf-plan capture` path in SKILL.md has no `update-status` call.

REQ-PORT-031: `/yf-plan capture` drafts missing contract files via the captor agent (`agents/captor.md`). The captor is read-only — drafts are returned for operator review and written by the main session only on approval.
Rationale: Mirrors the read-only review-agent pattern (REQ-AGENT-043) and keeps agent scope clean (per REQ-AGENT-050).
Verification: `agents/captor.md` Rules section: "Never write files. The main session writes after operator approval."

REQ-PORT-032: `/yf-plan capture --retro` **extends** (does not replace) folder-state capture by having the captor mine the **current session's conversation** for the seven portability classes: motivation, project environment, adjacent-concept glossary, reviewer verdicts/resolutions, upstream issue bodies, scope-change history, runtime/environment assumptions. Folder state takes precedence; the conversation only fills gaps. The captor remains read-only (REQ-PORT-031 / REQ-AGENT-061).
Rationale: Plans drafted before the portability contract existed, or rescoped mid-draft, carry load-bearing context only in the drafting conversation. `--retro` recovers it into the folder so the plan becomes portable. The seven classes are the recurring categories of conversation-only context.
Verification: SKILL.md Phase: CAPTURE "Retro mode (`--retro`)" enumerates the seven classes and the extends-not-replaces rule; `agents/captor.md` "Retro mode (`--retro`)" section enumerates the same seven classes and stays read-only.

REQ-PORT-033: `--retro` has a hard live-session boundary: it mines only the conversation it is run in and cannot recover a conversation already gone. When the drafting conversation is gone, plain `/yf-plan capture` (folder-state capture) is the fallback. The script-side flag is plumbing only: `plan_manager.py audit --retro` accepts the flag and surfaces it (`"retro"` in JSON output) but does not itself mine — the mechanical audit verdict is identical with or without `--retro`.
Rationale: Retro must not over-promise; a cold reader misled into thinking a gone conversation was recovered is worse than an honest gap. Keeping mining in the agent (not the script) preserves REQ-PORT-010 (the audit stays mechanical, no LLM calls).
Verification: SKILL.md Phase: CAPTURE Retro mode states the live-session boundary and current-session-only Rule; `agents/captor.md` Rules "Retro is current-session only"; `audit` command in plan_manager.py adds `result["retro"]` without altering `_audit_plan`.
