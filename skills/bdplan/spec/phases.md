# Phase Model Specification

## Phase Sequence

REQ-PHASE-001: The skill implements 7 phases: UPSTREAM, SCOPE, INVESTIGATE, PLAN, INTAKE, EXECUTE, RECONCILE.
Rationale: Each phase has a distinct responsibility; skipping phases produces incomplete plans or broken execution.
Verification: `grep -c '## Phase [0-6]' skills/bdplan/SKILL.md` returns 7.

REQ-PHASE-002: INTAKE and EXECUTE are separated by a session boundary. The start gate created during INTAKE can only be resolved in a new session via `/bdplan execute`.
Rationale: Forces the operator to consciously begin execution rather than auto-continuing from planning, preventing accidental execution of unapproved work.
Verification: SKILL.md Phase 4.8 instructs new session; Phase 5 heading states "in a new session".

REQ-PHASE-003: SCOPE and INVESTIGATE are bidirectional — investigation findings may revise scope.
Rationale: Experiments can reveal that the original scope was wrong or incomplete.
Verification: SKILL.md Phase 2 Transitions includes "Findings invalidate scope -> SCOPE".

REQ-PHASE-004: PLAN may return to SCOPE or INVESTIGATE if the draft reveals gaps.
Rationale: Plan synthesis is when gaps become visible; the model must be able to backtrack.
Verification: SKILL.md Phase 3 Iteration includes return-to-INVESTIGATE and return-to-SCOPE paths.

REQ-PHASE-005: PLAN advances to INTAKE only on explicit operator approval.
Rationale: The operator must review and approve the plan before any beads are created or work begins.
Verification: SKILL.md Phase 3 Iteration: `"approve" / "looks good" -> advance to INTAKE`.

## Status Values

REQ-STATUS-001: Exactly 8 status values exist: `scoping`, `investigating`, `drafting`, `review`, `approved`, `executing`, `reconciling`, `complete`.
Rationale: Status drives phase transitions and plan selection; extra or missing values break the state machine.
Verification: `grep 'Status values:' skills/bdplan/SKILL.md` lists all 8.

REQ-STATUS-002: Every phase transition sets status via `plan_manager.py update-status`.
Rationale: Centralizing status updates in one script prevents format drift between SKILL.md and plan.md.
Verification: `grep -c 'py update-status' skills/bdplan/SKILL.md` returns 7 (one per non-initial status; the bare `update-status` prose mention in the CAPTURE phase is excluded).

REQ-STATUS-003: Initial status `scoping` is set by `plan_manager.py init`, not by a separate `update-status` call.
Rationale: Plan creation and initial status are atomic — a plan.md without status is invalid.
Verification: `grep 'scoping' skills/bdplan/scripts/plan_manager.py` appears in `seed_plan_md`.

## Session Boundary

REQ-SESSION-001: The start gate is a human-type gate requiring operator resolution.
Rationale: Prevents automated execution without explicit human intent.
Verification: plan-execute.formula.toml `[steps.gate]` has `type = "human"`.

REQ-SESSION-002: `/bdplan execute` is the only entry point for the EXECUTE phase.
Rationale: Ensures the session boundary is respected; no other command can begin execution.
Verification: SKILL.md Phase 5 heading and 5.3 (resolve start gate) are only reached via `/bdplan execute`.

## Crash Recovery (Resume Guard + Orphan Sweep)

REQ-RESUME-001: Before resolving the start gate or entering the coordinator loop, EXECUTE detects whether the plan's epic already exists (a prior, possibly crashed, execute session). Detection is deterministic: `plan_manager.py resume-scan` reads the epic from plan.md's `**Epic:**` field, falling back to a bead whose `metadata.plan_dir` matches. If found, the operator is prompted (resume vs. new) via `AskUserQuestion`; execute never fabricates a second epic.
Rationale: A crashed execute session leaves an epic that a naive re-run would duplicate, producing two parallel bead DAGs for one plan. Deterministic detection (persisted ID, metadata fallback) makes resume reliable even for plans intaken before the `**Epic:**` field existed.
Verification: SKILL.md §5.2 "Resume guard" dispatches `resume-scan` and branches on `found`; §4.2 carries a duplicate-pour guard; `_resume_scan` in plan_manager.py resolves the epic via plan.md then metadata.

REQ-RESUME-002: On resume, the orphan sweep runs **strictly before the ready loop and before any reconcile-trigger evaluation**. The sweep **resets** stuck (`in_progress`/claimed) beads to `open` and **reports** — never auto-closes — any bead it cannot positively classify. No bead is ever auto-closed.
Rationale: The ready loop skips `in_progress` beads, so a crash silently strands them; resetting makes them re-workable. Auto-closing is unsafe — there is no bd-state signal separating disposable scratch from real `discovered-from` work — so the close decision stays with the operator.
Verification: SKILL.md §5.2 "Orphan sweep" and `agents/coordinator.md` → "Resume orphan sweep" specify reset-not-close and report-unclassifiable; ordering "before the ready loop and before reconcile-trigger evaluation" is stated in both.

REQ-RESUME-003: Resetting stuck beads (rather than closing them) keeps the epic non-terminal, so the reconcile gate cannot auto-fire on a resumed-but-incomplete plan.
Rationale: Closing the last stuck bead would satisfy the reconcile gate's "all execution beads closed" condition and trigger premature upstream reconciliation.
Verification: SKILL.md §5.2 and coordinator.md "Resume orphan sweep" both state reset keeps the epic non-terminal / prevents premature reconcile.
