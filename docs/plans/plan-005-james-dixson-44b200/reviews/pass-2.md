# Review Pass 2 — plan-005-james-dixson-44b200

**Verdict:** REVISE (all items now resolved in-place)
**Reviewer stance:** red-team (adversarial), read-only
**Date:** 2026-06-02

Pass-2 independently verified all 9 pass-1 resolutions against the source spec files
(confirming the REQ-AGENT-010..013 and REQ-AGENT-002/003 claims were factually accurate, not
over-stated) and cleared the execution-ordering hazard. It surfaced three new concerns, all
fixable in-place.

## Pass-1 resolutions — all verified holding

C1, C2 (high) independently confirmed against `skills/bdplan/spec/agents.md` (REQ-AGENT-010..013
name executor) and `skills/bdresearch/spec/agents.md` (REQ-AGENT-002 role list + REQ-AGENT-003
name critic). C3–C6, M1–M3 all verified present in plan.md. Execution ordering: the only
cross-skill refs are beads-authoring→bdplan executor (Epic 5.1) and an illustrative
PORTABILITY.md path (5.3); no earlier-epic consistency check re-checks a skill invalidated by
a not-yet-run later epic. Dependency ordering correct.

## New concerns (pass-2) — resolutions

| # | Severity | Concern | Resolution |
|---|----------|---------|------------|
| N1 | medium | `role` unassigned for ~9 unchanged agents; toolsmith/triangulator/refiner genuinely contestable; toolsmith unmentioned in the plan. | Issue 1.3 now ships a canonical role table for all 21 agents with rationale for the contestable ones (toolsmith→produce, triangulator→produce, refiner→revise) and documents PRODUCE/CLOSEOUT as multi-member families. "valid role" = "matches the table". |
| N2 | medium | Issue 2.2 named the reviewer/red-team split but not what the new conformance `reviewer.md` contains. | Issue 2.2 now specifies the conformance checklist (epic/issue/dep-acyclicity/success-criterion-verifiability/upstream-wiring/gate/portability) and a `PASS\|INCOMPLETE` output contract distinct from the adversarial verdict. |
| N3 | missing→high | REQ-AGENT-040..043 + SKILL.md Phase 3 pin the `APPROVE\|REVISE\|INVESTIGATE-MORE` verdict to `reviewer.md`; after the split that behavior moves to `red-team.md`, uncovered by the 2.4 grep. | Issue 2.2 retargets REQ-AGENT-040..043 to `red-team.md`, adds a conformance-reviewer REQ, and rewires SKILL.md §3 so the red-team verdict drives the transition (pass-N.md lifecycle stays on the red-team verdict). Issue 2.4 verifies no orphaned reviewer.md verdict clause remains. New risk row added. |

## Strengths (pass-2)

- Both high-severity REQ-ID claims from pass-1 are factually accurate against the spec files.
- Grep acceptance gates (2.4/3.3/4.4/5.4) are scoped to the right directories.
- Execution-ordering across epics is clean — verified, no false-positive consistency flags.

## Gate Assessment

Unchanged and correct: Start Gate only; no capability gates; no reconcile gate.

## Upstream Assessment

Sound and unchanged. Land-the-plane note carried from pass-1: the new role vocabulary is a
documented decision worth filing upstream so peer clones inherit it.

## Operator Resolutions

| # | Resolution | Status |
|---|------------|--------|
| N1 | Canonical 21-agent role table added to Issue 1.3 with contestable-agent rationale. | resolved |
| N2 | Conformance `reviewer.md` checklist + `PASS\|INCOMPLETE` contract specified in Issue 2.2. | resolved |
| N3 | REQ-AGENT-040..043 retargeted to red-team.md; SKILL.md §3 verdict ownership rewired; Issue 2.4 verifies. New risk row added. | resolved |
