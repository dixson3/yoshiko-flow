# Project Environment Context

_Snapshot taken at plan-authoring time. Cold readers: verify these values
against the current environment before acting. The snapshot header below
records the machine and date of capture._

## Project environment

Describe the project this plan belongs to: what it does, what stack it uses,
any non-obvious setup. A cold reader should not need to infer this from code.

## Tool inventory

<!-- snapshot: host=d3-mbp-m5.local date=2026-08-21 -->

## Runtime assumptions

List the assumptions this plan makes about the environment it will execute in
(OS, shell, network access, credentials, side-effect permissions). A cold
reader on a different machine should be able to decide whether the plan is
safe to run as-is.

## Adjacent-concept glossary

_Optional._ Terms, acronyms, or project-specific jargon the plan uses.

## Additional context

_Optional._ Anything else a cold reader needs that does not fit above.
